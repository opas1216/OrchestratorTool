# OrchestratorTool
I want to build a orchestrator website for managing the usage of RPA bot and make it can activate it remotely.
Below are the steps I consider to finish:
1. First thing first, I have to build a website with simple UI.(Frontend).
2. Develop backend, I don't know how to say what is I have to do.
3. API and DB.
4. Try integrate RPA(UiPath) bot into website.
5. Add features into orchestrator, such as: Monitor the bot usage, Data report visualization, Log tracking system, Service support system.
6. Don't know yet.
If anyone has ideas please feel free to contact me.
And I'm a junior RPA Developer, and I want to be a professional software engineer.
I know I have a lots things to learn, if anyone can give me advice, I'll be very appreciate it.
